# AddressApp

First JavaFX MVC project. Utilizes JAXB to marshall and unmarshall person data as XML. Included are a sample list of persons that can have
their Information edited or deleted. You can also make your own list of persons, family, friends, coworkers, and save their person data
as XML. Birthday Statistics are available as a chart that shows frequency of birthdays to months.
Based on tutorial: http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/
NOTICE: It's preferred to run AddressApp inside Eclipse for full functionality. Doing so would require this plugin: http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html
